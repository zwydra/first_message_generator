            <p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
            <p>This project is a modern take on the 1952 program “Loveletters” by Christopher Strachey which is often considered to be one of the first creative algorithms. The list of words used as variables was adjusted to the language used by creators of erotic fanfiction on the platform Archive of Our Own (AO3). The fanfictions for this project were chosen based on their popularity in the “Smut” tag on the AO3 platform. The specific words used for this project were chosen based on the frequency with which they appear in the sources. Certain words were used over ten times in the sources. The results produced by this reformed algorithm are sexual in nature and can often be considered obscene. This can be considered as a case study for the evolution of the language of human desires.</p>
            <p>The title and subtitle of the project are a playful commentary on communication on dating apps which tends to skip the phase of polite courtship to go straight into crude sexual, suggestions and remarks.</p>
